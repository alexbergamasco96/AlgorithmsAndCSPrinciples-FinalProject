# Algorithm and Computer Science Principles - Course Project



The aim of this project is to create a simple filesystem in **C** with these functionalities:
* *create* : create a new .txt file
* *create_dir* : create a new directory
* *delete* : delete a file
* *delete_dir* : delete a directory
* *find* : return the path/paths of file/files named with the string passed as an input

The core part of the project is to implement in a smart way algorithms and structures explained during the course, balancing the trade-off between space and time complexity. Both these complexities are tested with public and private tests performed by professors.
